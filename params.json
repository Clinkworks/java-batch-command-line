{"name":"Java-batch-command-line","body":"This is a template that I have used a couple times to make simple Java applications.\r\n\r\nlibraries used\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  * Logback (successor to log4j)\r\n  * Maven (ugh)\r\n  * JCommander (Command-line Option parsing)\r\n  * Google Guice (dependency injection)\r\n  * Google Guava (all the goodies)\r\n  * Maven AppAssembler (to generate a self-contained java app with\r\n    `.bat` and `sh` scripts)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis includes a couple example classes surrounding how to use JCommander and\r\nGoogle Guice for dependency injection.  Logback includes a default logback.xml\r\nfile that's annotated with my most commonly-used defaults.\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting?\r\n--------\r\nI'm sure there are a litany of testing frameworks out there (which language \r\ndoesn't have at least 5 - 10 different tools for this?) but I haven't really \r\nsettled on anything other than what I consider the vanilla choice: JUnit.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\nSince this relies on knowledge of alot of these frameworks, I would say these libraries\r\nprovided me the msot documentation, which is part of the reason I picked them:\r\n\r\n  - [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/)\r\n    - [Logback Manual](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html)\r\n\t- [Configuring Logback (and the `logback.xml` file)](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html)\r\n  - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org)\r\n\t- [Maven Filtering](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.html)\r\n\t- [Maven AppAssembler plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/appassembler/appassembler-maven-plugin/) (for generating `.bat` and `sh` script-runnable projects)\r\n  - [JCommander](http://jcommander.org)\r\n  - [Google Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/GettingStarted)\r\n  - [Google Guava](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)\r\n\t- [Java API](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git-history/v11.0.1/javadoc/index.html)\r\n\t- [Guava Explained (what's in it)](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/GuavaExplained)\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\nQuestions, concerns, etc., can be directed to me `klauer` `@` `gmail` `.` `com`","tagline":"template for java batch jobs","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
